			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I obtained PhD in physics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2004, and the other in ecology and evolution from the University of Helsinki in 2009. Now I work in the field of statistical and quantitative genetics. 

My general research interest is to understand complex biological systems by applying tools from statistics, mathematics, physics, and computer science. Specifically, I am interested in developing mechanistic and probabilistic models and link them to empirical data by applying my quantitative expertise in stochastic modeling and Bayesian inference.
